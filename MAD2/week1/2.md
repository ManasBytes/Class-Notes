# Why History ?
So that we can have a context of why was something developed and all. I still ask the same question, why history.

Arourd 1995, Java was founded by Sun Microsystems (James Gosling), and Java was designed in a way that i could be designed in a way in order to implement something called applets.
**Applet**  -  A small java program that could be embedded within a web page and can be ran inside a web browser, designed to make websites more dynamic and interactive.

With this applet - now we could write full blown application to control a part of the web browser. this meant all the full blown applications could now be possible to run just on the web browser, and not required to have certain software locally for it to be able to run.

This kind of revolutionaized the entire sphere of web development. 

Along with this **Netscape Navigator** then introduced a scripting language, to make full applications in the web page it self, in the web browser it self. This is where **Javascript** got invented.

Javascript was meant to assist the Java Applets, and not really meant for coding. It was intennded to become a **Glue** language, which can stick different modules together, different applets together.

**Power**

Javascript was doing good as a scripting language but it was slow. Therefore people came up with solutions. One of the major solution among them was brought up by Google, with its Google Maps and Google Suggest etc (2005)

**AJAX** - Asynchronous Javascript and XML 
Garrett found the solution. Problem was, in google maps, they want to load the things, for only what is needed, nothing else. this was made possible by Async  JS. and again, it made the web applications more desktop like applications.
Also, the UI it became more and more fluid everytime, since the load on the network significantly reduced.
