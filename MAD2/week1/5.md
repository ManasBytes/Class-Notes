# Lecture 5

1. **Null and Undefined**
   - **Undefined** - Usually implies not initialized. It is the default unknown state.
   - **null** - Usually set to a none value. We declare null, declared by a programmer.
   - Very similar and very much used interchangably, but it is good to keep the context in mind
2. **Const and Let**
   - **Const** -  It declares an immutable object, value cannot be changed and it works within the scope.
   - **Let** - Variable that can be updated, these are mutable, meaning the value can be reassigned through out the use. Works within scope.
3. **Control Flow**
   - Conditional execution: if else

4. **Anynomous Functions** // IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression
   - > let x = function () {return 'hello'}
   - this is an anynomous function, there is no name given to the function, the function is bound to the variable x.
   - > (function () {return "hello" } () )  // declare and invoke
   - this is one step further. i made the anynomous function and immediately invoked it right now.
   - avoid it as much possible, initially when the var was not scoped, then this was a way around. But now there is no good way of using it
