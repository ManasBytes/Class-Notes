Javascript in a sense is closer to python than to C

1. **Identifiers**
   - The words of the language
     - Reserved Words - if while await break case else .. etc
     - Literals(values) - true(1) false(0) null(Undefined)
     - Others to avoid - enum, package, implements, protected, interface, private, public, Infinity, undefined NaN async
2. **Statements and Expressions**
   - In terms of structure of the language one thing to keep in mind is, that JS can be broadly divided into statements and expressions
   - *Statements* - Piece of Code that can be executed. It is about doing something and not producing something, it maintains control, flow and structure of the code.
   - *Expression* - An expression is anything that produces a value. A piece of code that returns a value.

Basic things mentioned which really doesnt need to be mentioned here.
